# Hi there, I'm Destiny! 👋
### AI Automation Engineer | n8n Specialist | Systems Architect

> "Most businesses don't hit a ceiling because of demand — they hit it because operations can't scale."

I design and build intelligent automation systems that eliminate manual friction. I specialize in replacing repetitive operational overhead with autonomous **n8n workflows** and **AI Agents**.

---

## 🛠️ The Problem I Solve
If you are committing code to a repo, you shouldn't be copy-pasting data manually in your business. I help scaling coaches and service businesses who are stuck doing this:

- ❌ **15+ hrs/week** on manual client onboarding
- ❌ Sending repetitive email follow-ups manually
- ❌ Acting as a human API between 5+ different tools
- ❌ Creating static reports that don't drive decisions

## 🚀 How I Fix It
I refactor business operations into code and workflows.
**My Goal:** Move you from "Human-in-the-loop" for everything, to "Human-on-the-loop" for strategy.

## ⚡ What I Build
I don't just zap data from A to B. I build systems that handle logic.

1.  **Autonomous Onboarding:** Full stack integration from payment → contract → course access → welcome sequence.
2.  **AI Agents:** Intelligent bots that handle routing, logic, and draft responses based on context, not just keywords.
3.  **Workflow Audits:** Identifying bottlenecks in your current tech stack (API limitations, logic gaps).

## 📈 Use Cases
I primarily engineer solutions for:
* **Coaches** scaling from 1-on-1 to Group/Digital programs.
* **Service Agencies** drowning in operational overhead.
* **Lean Teams** wanting to scale revenue without bloating headcount.
